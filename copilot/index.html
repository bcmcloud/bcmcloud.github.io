				<p class="intro-last"><span class="calibre8">Noticing your progress</span></p>
				<p class="fm-normal"><span class="calibre8">W</span><span class="calibre8">hat do people all have in common &ndash; whatever their age, health, wealth or occupation? They all recognise an angry face when they see it. Anger &ndash; along with joy, fear, sadness and surprise &ndash; is a universal emotion. All cultures around the world see and show anger as an integral and normal part of daily life.</span></p>
				<p class="fm-normal"><span class="calibre8">So if anger is completely normal, why pick this book up? Anger is a normal feeling, but it can become too strong, happen too often and start to have a negative impact on your life or the lives of those around you. Anger management is a life skill, simply like building in a volume control, allowing you to feel your natural emotions without being tripped up by them.</span></p>
				<p class="normal-w-icon"><img alt="remember.eps" src="images/00004.jpeg" class="calibre11" /><span class="calibre8"> Anger is part of a basic survival mechanism of human beings. When faced with a threat, like other animals, humans either run away or attack &ndash; fear triggers a reaction to get you ready for ‘fight’ or ‘flight’, and in ‘fight’ mode anger is often the fuel behind that attack. Both are built in for your survival, but excessive anger can also have the opposite effect and lead to serious health problems, even an early death. As Chapter 3 explains, too much anger can cause health problems, make you vulnerable to accidents and lead you to take serious risks. Anger truly is a double-edged sword.</span></p>
				<p class="heading" id="calibre_link-18"><span>Dispelling Common Anger Myths</span></p>
				<p class="fm-normal"><span class="calibre8">Before you can manage your own anger well, you need to know what anger is and isn’t. Unfortunately, myths about anger seem to abound. Here are some of the myths we want to dispel right from the start:</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">Anger is bad. </span><span class="calibre8">Anger serves a variety of positive purposes when it comes to coping with stress. It motivates you, improves your communication with other people, promotes your self-esteem and defends you against threats. People like Gandhi and Martin Luther King were angry about injustice, but they turned that anger into social reform that changed the way people live and made the world a better place.</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">Anger is good.</span><span class="calibre8"> When it leads to violence to others, property damage, verbal abuse, drug addiction, self-mutilation or any other destructive behaviour, anger is definitely not good. Living with angry feelings, either constant fury or hidden grudges, can also have a damaging effect on your long-term physical health (see Chapter 3).</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">Anger is only a problem when you openly express it.</span><span class="calibre8"> As few as 10 per cent of people act out their feelings when they get angry. The other 90 per cent either suppress their anger (‘I don’t want to talk about it!’) or repress their anger (‘I’m not angry at all &ndash; really!’). People who express their anger may get everyone’s attention (aggression); people who repress or suppress their anger cause equal distress and need anger management just as much (passive aggression).</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">The older you get, the more irritable you are.</span><span class="calibre8"> It’s the other way around &ndash; as people age, they report fewer negative emotions and greater emotional control. Psychologists and researchers have established that people &ndash; like wine and cheese &ndash; do tend to mellow with age.</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">Males are angrier than females. </span><span class="calibre8">If by angrier you mean how often people feel anger, it’s simply not true that men are angrier than women. Surveys show that women get angry just as frequently as men &ndash; about once or twice a week on average. On the other hand, men tend to report more intense anger and women tend to feel anger for longer</span><span class="zcheltitalic">.</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">Anger is all in the mind.</span><span class="calibre8"> Nothing could be farther from the truth. All emotions have chemical and physical beginnings in the body. If anger were only a state of mind, why would someone say, ‘I feel like I’m burning with anger?’ or ‘That makes my blood boil.’ When you get angry that emotion instantly affects muscles throughout your body, the hairs on the back of your neck, your blood pressure, your blood sugar levels, your heart rate, your respiration rate, your gut, even your finger temperature &ndash; long before you’re aware of what’s happening. This is a biological response &ndash; you can’t change it, but you can control it.</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">Anger is all about getting even.</span><span class="calibre8"> In fact the most common motive behind anger has been shown to be the wish for authority or independence, or to improve your image &ndash; not necessarily to cause harm. Revenge is a less common motive. A third motive involves letting off steam over built-up frustrations &ndash; again, with no apparent intent to harm anyone else.</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">Only certain types of people have a problem with anger.</span><span class="calibre8"> Actually, over the years we’ve spent helping people with anger management we’ve worked with all types of people &ndash; lorry drivers, university professors, doctors, housewives, grandmothers, lawyers, policemen, career criminals, poor people, millionaires, children, the elderly and people of different cultures, nationalities and religions. Anger is a universal emotion!</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">Anger results from human conflict.</span><span class="calibre8"> Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Experts on anger have found that people can get angry as a result of being exposed to foul odours, pain or hot temperatures &ndash; none of which involve (or can be blamed on) the actions of others.</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">People who have problems with anger are bad people.</span><span class="calibre8"> This is not true. The effects of poor anger management can be bad &ndash; for your feelings, your health, your relationships, your hopes. But why would you be reading this book if you enjoyed being angry and destructive? Only a tiny percentage of humans take pleasure from hurting or causing suffering to others.</span></p>
				<p class="heading" id="calibre_link-19"><span>Understanding the Role of Emotions in Your Life</span></p>
				<p class="fm-normal"><span class="calibre8">Emotion is a compound word. The </span><span class="zcheltitalic">e</span><span class="calibre8"> stands for ‘energy’ and the </span><span class="zcheltitalic">motion</span><span class="calibre8"> means exactly what it says &ndash; ‘movement’. Emotions </span><span class="zcheltitalic">move</span><span class="calibre8"> you to act in ways that defend you from threat, lead to social and intimate attachments, motivate you to take part in things you get pleasure from and lead you to explore your environment. Without emotion, life would be at a standstill.</span></p>
				<p class="normal-w-icon"><img alt="technicalstuff.eps" src="images/00014.jpeg" class="calibre11" /><span class="calibre8"> Scientists understand the biological causes of anger to be similar to those of all strong emotions; for instance, intense love, triumph or terror. The sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate and blood pressure, and the adrenal gland produces the hormone adrenaline, which controls many of the body’s responses to stress. The purpose is to prepare the body for ‘fight or flight’ and during this emergency response some body functions are temporarily unnecessary:</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="calibre8">Blood circulation to digestion is reduced (causing nausea or ‘butterflies’).</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="calibre8">Circulation to fingers and toes is reduced (which is why someone who’s afraid might be said to ‘have cold feet’).</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="calibre8">Skin may become red in response to production of the hormone epinephrine (a similar response is seen in some animals).</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="calibre8">The heart pumps faster to deliver oxygen to muscles, raising blood pressure as the smaller blood vessels tighten, pushing blood to the parts of the body needed to fight or retreat.</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="calibre8">Sweating can increase as the body maintains temperature balance (which rises with increased breathing and heart rates).</span></p>
				<p class="fm-normal"><span class="calibre8">Anger, then, has a big effect on your body. So, you want to have emotions but you want to be in control of those emotions. You want to let anger move you to write a letter to the editor in your local newspaper about some social injustice. You want your anger to move you to stand up for yourself when your boss is exploiting your talents at work. Anger that says to your partner, ‘Hey, something’s not working here’ is good for a marriage. But if your anger causes you to hurt others &ndash; or yourself &ndash; then you definitely have a problem.</span></p>
				<p class="normal-w-icon"><img alt="tip.eps" src="images/00015.jpeg" class="calibre11" /><span class="calibre8"> Think of anger as a tool that can help you throughout life if you know how to use it &ndash; and think of </span><span class="zcheltitalic">Anger Management For Dummies</span><span class="calibre8"> as a reference on how best to use that tool.</span></p>
				<p class="fm-normal"><span class="calibre8">The real culprit when it comes to anger is </span><span class="zcheltitalic">how much</span><span class="calibre8"> of it a person experiences, </span><span class="zcheltitalic">how often</span><span class="calibre8"> and </span><span class="zcheltitalic">how long</span><span class="calibre8"> for. The logic here is simple: if you rarely get angry; if, when you do, it’s not too intense; and if your anger is over in a minute, it really doesn’t matter whether you keep it in or let it out. You don’t have enough of it to cause you, or anyone else, a problem.</span></p>
				<p class="fm-normal"><span class="calibre8">Similarly, if you’re repeatedly angry throughout the day, your anger is extremely intense and you stay that way for the rest of the day or longer, it doesn’t matter whether you’re aggressive or passive-aggressive type &ndash; either way you have a problem. If you keep that much anger in, you’ll pay a price &ndash; in the form of depression, heart attack, resentment, relationship problems and so on. If you let that much anger out, you’ll pay a different price &ndash; in the form of legal fees, divorce, job loss and so on. The way you express excessive anger simply determines the type of consequences you pay.</span></p>
<div class="sidebar">
				<p class="sb-head"><span> Do you really want to change?</span></p>
				<p class="sb-body"><span class="calibre8">You’re interested in making a change: you wouldn’t be looking at this book if you weren’t! Yes, hundreds of thousands of people have made changes to the way they handle their anger, and it starts with curiosity: ‘Can I do it? How do I do it?’ The worst thing about problems &ndash; including excessive anger &ndash; is that you can get used to them, and that makes it difficult for you to change. People aren’t born thinking (language is learned later) and aren’t born with patterns of automatic behaviour, or habits. These come as we go through life, and we rely on them to make life manageable. How difficult would life become if you had to concentrate as hard at 30 as you did at 3 on dressing yourself? How would you find your way home after a busy day? Of course, not all habits are healthy. Overweight people know they need to lose weight, but overeating and avoiding exercise become habits, just as smoking or heavy drinking do. Habits in our style of relating to others are also powerful in our life &ndash; unhealthy ones such as lying or blaming, or healthy ones such as openness and showing affection. The great news is that habits are learned. Anything you learned, you can unlearn, or relearn! It just takes the decision ‘I really want to change this’ and focus, so that you take every opportunity and keep on going until you succeed.</span></p>
				<p class="sb-body"><span class="calibre8">We believe in being honest with people, so we tell them from the outset that it’s far easier to stay the same than it is to change. So, if you’re looking for the easy way out, there isn’t one. Not changing requires absolutely no energy, motivation or commitment on your part &ndash; but change does. If you want to try, this book is for you &ndash; and the rewards can be amazing. Our experiences, and those of friends and clients, include a more peaceful mind, more pleasure from life, seeing the funny side of frustrating daily hassles, better relationships (genuine ones!) with fewer hurt feelings, grudges and missed chances.</span></p>

				<p class="heading" id="calibre_link-20"><span>Getting the Help You Need</span></p>
				<p class="fm-normal"><span class="calibre8">Everybody needs support &ndash; nobody can go through life completely alone. Humans are social animals. When you’re embarking on a major change in your life, the help of other people is especially important. And managing your anger is a major life change.</span></p>
				<p class="normal-w-icon"><img alt="remember.eps" src="images/00004.jpeg" class="calibre11" /><span class="calibre8"> Support comes in many forms. To manage your anger effectively, you need all the following kinds of support:</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">Emotional support.</span><span class="calibre8"> You need people who are behind you 100 per cent, people who know about your problems with anger and are cheering you on as you work out how to manage it.</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">Feedback</span><span class="calibre8"> </span><span class="zcheltbold1">support.</span><span class="calibre8"> You need people who are willing to give you honest feedback about your anger, as well as any improvement you’ve made &ndash; no matter how small.</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">Informational support.</span><span class="calibre8"> You can have the best of intentions, but if you don’t have the information you need about anger and how to manage it, it’s hard to change. Here, you hold in your hands all the information you need to get control of your unhelpful anger.</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">Practical support.</span><span class="calibre8"> Sometimes you need some hands-on support. An angry mother who’s on the verge of losing her temper and abusing her child really needs her partner or friend to step in while she takes a break to calm down. Ten minutes of practical help can make all the difference.</span></p>
				<p class="normal-w-icon"><span class="calibre8"><img alt="tip.eps" class="calibre11" src="images/00015.jpeg" /></span><span class="calibre8"> To use all the support you need in order to succeed at anger management:</span></p>

				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">Keep in mind that most people want to be supportive &ndash; they’re just waiting for you to give them a chance. </span><span class="calibre8">Take the initiative and ask your closest friends and family members for their support. Support that goes unrecognised or unused does you no good. Most people have far more support than they take advantage of. This is no time to think, ‘I don’t want to be a burden on anyone.’ Trust us, you’re more of a burden when you’re angry than when you’ve gained control!</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">Be willing to give support to your friends and family in return.</span><span class="calibre8"> Support must be a two-way street. In order to receive it, you must give it. A part of what you give back will come through taking control of your anger, and the benefit this brings everyone.</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="zcheltbold1">Remember that no one person can satisfy all your support needs. </span><span class="calibre8">One person may be able to offer emotional support, and another may help out in a more practical way.</span></p>
				<p class="normal-w-icon"><img alt="warning_bomb.eps" src="images/00011.jpeg" class="calibre11" /><span class="calibre8"> Don’t be too surprised if, at first, you have trouble getting support for your efforts at anger management. You may have hurt a lot of people with your anger over the years and they may have some remaining resentment, fear and uncertainty. That’s natural. But if you’re truly committed to managing your anger, the chances are much higher that people will eventually come around.</span></p>
				<p class="heading" id="calibre_link-21"><span>Knowing You’re Getting There</span></p>
				<p class="fm-normal"><span class="calibre8">Often people who’ve been successful at anger management have a hard time appreciating just how far they’ve come in their emotional life.</span></p>
				<p class="fm-normal"><span class="calibre8">The author Gill had a moment of fury when faced with drunken abuse from someone she’d always supported, in front of friends and family, and at a funeral. Gill was so angry she couldn’t speak, and was shaking when she walked away. Using many of the skills we outline in this book to calm down and regain her emotional balance, she delayed speaking to the woman again until she was sober and instead thought about those she was glad to be with (letting anger go). Gill had forgotten what that kind of shocking anger felt like. But after it subsided she realised that the reason it felt so awful was because this was the first time for a long time that she’d felt such a strong rush of anger.</span></p>
				<p class="normal-w-icon"><img alt="remember.eps" src="images/00004.jpeg" class="calibre11" /><span class="calibre8"> So how will you know that you’re getting there? Here are some ways you can tell you’re succeeding in managing your anger:</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="calibre8">You begin to realise that you can see the things that used to set you off </span><span class="zcheltitalic">before</span><span class="calibre8"> you react to them. This gives you the time to make choices about how you handle them.</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="calibre8">People who know you well begin to give you unsolicited positive feedback about your improved temper.</span></p>
				<p class="bullet"><span class="calibre8">That angry ‘fist’ you feel in your chest, or the arguments in your head, day after day, are no longer there &ndash; replaced by a calm sense of control.</span></p>
				<p class="fm-normal"><span class="calibre8">But in many respects the work of anger management is never done &ndash; you’re always a ‘work in progress’. Every day is an opportunity to exercise your anger-management muscles.</span></p>
				<p class="normal-w-icon"><img alt="warning_bomb.eps" src="images/00011.jpeg" class="calibre11" /><span class="calibre8"> If you slip up and sulk, or have an outburst, don’t fall into the trap of being irritated about being irritated or see it as a setback. Instead, we believe that each slip gives you another chance to practise what you’re trying to learn until it becomes your new habit. Don’t be angry with yourself &ndash; try using the energy to have another try. Turn the energy spent on anger into determination to succeed.</span></p>
